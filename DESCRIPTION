Authors@R: person("Frankie", "Cho", email = "htcho@connect.hku.hk", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: The Analytic Hierarchy Process is a versatile multi-criteria decision-making tool that allows decision-makers to weigh attributes and evaluate alternatives presented to them.    This package provides a consistent methodology for researchers to reformat data and run analytic hierarchy process in R on data that are formatted using the survey data entry mode. It is optimized for performing the analytic hierarchy process with many decision-makers, and provides tools and options for researchers to aggregate individual preferences and test multiple options. It also allows researchers to quantify, visualize and correct for inconsistency in the decision-maker's comparisons.
