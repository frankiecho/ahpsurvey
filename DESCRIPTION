Description: The Analytic Hierarchy Process is a versatile multi-criteria decision-making tool introduced by Saaty (1987) <doi:10.1016/0270-0255(87)90473-8> that allows decision-makers to weigh attributes and evaluate alternatives presented to them.    This package provides a consistent methodology for researchers to reformat data and run analytic hierarchy process in R on data that are formatted using the survey data entry mode. It is optimized for performing the analytic hierarchy process with many decision-makers, and provides tools and options for researchers to aggregate individual preferences and test multiple options. It also allows researchers to quantify, visualize and correct for inconsistency in the decision-maker's comparisons.
