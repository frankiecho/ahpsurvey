## Test environments
* macOS High Sierra 10.13.6 with R 3.5.1 (local system)
* Ubuntu 12.04 (on travis-ci), R-oldrel, R-release, R-devel
* win-builder (devel and release)

## R CMD check results
0 ERRORs | 0 WARNINGs | 0 NOTES (on local system)

There was one NOTE when win-builder was ran. It said:

* NOTE: Maintainer: 'Frankie Cho <htcho@connect.hku.hk>'

There should not be any problems with this as it only asks me to reconfirm whether I was the right maintainer of this package.
