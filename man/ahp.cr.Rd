\title{Calculates the consistency ratio of each decision-maker}
\usage{
ahp.cr(ahpmat, atts)
}
\arguments{
\item{ahpmat}{A list of pairwise comparison matrices of each decision maker generated by \code{ahp.mat}.}

\item{atts}{a list of attributes in the correct order. The RI is asymptotic as it approaches n=15, thus it is set to be equal to 1.6 if the number of attributes exceeds 16.}
}
\value{
A \code{list} of consistency ratios of each decision-maker.
}
\description{
The \code{ahp.cr} function calculates the consistency ratio of each decision-maker, defined by the following equation:

\deqn{CR = (\lambda-n)/((n-1)(RI))}

Where \eqn{\lambda} is the maximum eigenvalue of the pairwise comparison matrix, \eqn{n} is the number of attributes, and RI is the random index. Following \insertCite{Saaty2007fuzzy;textual}{ahpsurvey}, the RI is a function of \eqn{n} and is the consistency ratio of randomly generated pairwise comparison matrices. The first seven random indices from n=1 to n=7 are given as follows: \code{0,0,0.52,0.89,1.11,1.25,1.35}.
